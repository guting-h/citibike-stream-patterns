# citibike-stream-patterns
First course project for CS-E4780 (Scalable Systems and Data Management). Implements a Complex Event Processing (CEP) system on top of OpenCEP to detect "hot paths" in the Citi Bike dataset. Includes load shedding strategies to ensure low-latency processing under high workload while balancing recall and throughput.
